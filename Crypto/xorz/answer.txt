In faith I do not love thee wi
th mine eyes,For they in thee
a thousand errors note;But `ti
s my heart that loves what the
y despise,Who in despite of vi
ew is pleased to dote.Nor are
mine ears with thy tongue`s tu
ne delighted;Nor tender feelin
g to base touches prone,Nor ta
ste, nor smell, desire to be i
nvitedTo any sensual feast wit
h thee alone.But my five wits,
 nor my five senses canDissuad
e one foolish heart from servi
ng thee,Who leaves unswayed th
e likeness of a man,Thy proud
heart`s slave and vassal wretc
h to be.Only my plague thus fa
r I count my gain,That she tha
t makes me sin awards me pain.
