I  faith I do not love thee wi
t& mine eyes,For they in thee
anthousand errors note;But `ti
snmy heart that loves what the
yndespise,Who in despite of vi
e9 is pleased to dote.Nor are
m'ne ears with thy tongue`s tu
n+ delighted;Nor tender feelin
gnto base touches prone,Nor ta
s:e, nor smell, desire to be i
n8itedTo any sensual feast wit
hnthee alone.But my five wits,
  or my five senses canDissuad
enone foolish heart from servi
n) thee,Who leaves unswayed th
enlikeness of a man,Thy proud
h+art`s slave and vassal wretc
hnto be.Only my plague thus fa
rnI count my gain,That she tha
tnmakes me sin awards me pain.
